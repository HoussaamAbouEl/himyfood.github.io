            diced garlic lightly cooked in olive oil, into which the cooked spaghetti is then tossed. Spaghetti lends itself 
            to serving with small shellfish such as mussels and clams, and in many Italian households a favourite dish is 
            spaghetti al tonno, spaghetti with tomato sauce and canned tuna.

        <p class="descr1">
            Ossobuco is a traditional Italian dish made with veal 
            or beef shanks that are slow-cooked with vegetables, white wine, 
            and broth. The shanks are typically seared on the stovetop to develop a
             rich, brown crust, and then simmered in a flavorful broth for several hours
              until the meat is tender and falls off the bone. Ossobuco is often served with 
              gremolata, a mixture of lemon zest, garlic, and parsley, sprinkled over the top 
              to brighten the flavors. The dish is typically enjoyed as a main course and is often 
              accompanied by risotto, polenta, or crusty bread.
