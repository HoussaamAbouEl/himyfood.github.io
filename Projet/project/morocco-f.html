        <img class="img1" src="../p-photos-pays/morocco/Tagin.jpg" alt="!!!">
        <p class="descr1">
            Tagine is beloved as both a type of cookware and a type of 
            dish. The Tagine is more or less a portable oven — a means 
            to have a hot meal with stewed meats and/or vegetables 
            anytime, any place. The clay pot consists of 2 parts — 
            the base is a shallow dish, while the top fits snugly on 
            the bottom. It is a cone shape that serves as both a handle 
            and an area for the steam to collect and fall back down to 
            the food, providing continuous moisture (via The Telegraph)

        <h1 class="h12">2) <a href="">Tanjia</a></h1>

        <p class="descr2" id="descr11">
            You already know the Tagine, but let us introduce you to 
            its cousin, Tanjia. Just like Tagine, Tanjia is the name of 
            a cooking vessel, and like Tagine, it's also the name of the 
            resulting dish. However, Tanjia is cooked low and slow, and 
            instead of cooking directly over a fire like Tagine, it is 
            left to slowly cook over smoldering ashes. You might find 
            that the Tanjia looks like a vase or a water jug with 2 handles on either side
        </p>
        <h1 class="h11">3)  <a href="">Couscous</a></h1>
        <img class="img1" src="../p-photos-pays/morocco/couscous.jpg" alt="!!!">
        <p class="descr1">
            In Western countries, couscous is often served as a base 
            for Tajine, but that's not how it's often eaten in Morocco. 
            My Moroccan Food explains that the word "couscous" often refers 
            to the entire dish, which usually consists of meat and vegetables 
            cooked in a broth. It is then served on a bed of steamed semolina 
            granules, what are traditionally referred to as couscous in the Western 
            world. Couscous is made up of tiny balls of semolina flour. It's often 
            served communally and made in large quantities to celebrate Morocco's 
            National Holy Day, which is Friday.

        <img class="img2" src="../p-photos-pays/morocco/bastilla.jfif" alt="!!">
        <p class="descr2">
            Pastilla is the type of hearty dish that screams hearty home 
            cooking. It's a pie that's made in a skillet — think a tender, 
            perfectly spiced, moist filling inside a flaky crust. The dough 
            is called warqa, and its layers and textures are similar to filo dough.

        <h1 class="h11">5) <a href="">Rfisa</a></h1>
        <img class="img1" src="../p-photos-pays/morocco/rfissa.jfif" alt="!!!">
        <p class="descr1">
            Another favorite food in Morocco is this one. Rfissa is a very popular 
            dish in Morocco during celebrations.
            It is traditionally made with Msemen pastry bread (Found in Moroccan breakfasts), 
            chicken, lentil, and chicken broth.
            This Moroccan savory dish cannot be 
            served without its two main ingredients, the Fenugreek 
            spice, and Ras El Hanout a blend of several spices.
        </p>
        <h1 class="h12">6) <a href="">Zaalouk</a></h1>
        <img class="img2" src="../p-photos-pays/morocco/zaalouk.jpeg" alt="!!!">
        <p class="descr2">
            Moroccan food has been influenced by many cultures 
            over the centuries, and no dish is a greater example 
            of that than Zaalouk. This dish is made by grilling 
            or roasting eggplants and mixing them into cooked and 
            spiced tomatoes. It is particularly popular amongst 
            Moroccan Jews, who eat the salad during Shabbat (via Morocco Jewish Times).
        </p>
        <h1 class="h11">7) <a href="">Harira</a></h1>
        <img class="img1" src="../p-photos-pays/morocco/harira.jpeg" alt="!!!">
        <p class="descr1">
            Harira is Morocco's national soup. It is beloved across the 
            country and each family typically puts its own spin on the dish. 
            It is hearty but still has a light tomato base, so it's the perfect 
            soup to enjoy during Ramadan, as many Moroccan families do. However, 
            that's not to say it can't be eaten during other times of the year as well.
        </p>
        <h1 class="h12">8)  <a href="">Seffa</a></h1>
        <img class="img2" src="../p-photos-pays/morocco/sefa.jpg" alt="!!!">
        <p class="descr2">
            The famed Moroccan dish Seffa is made by steaming broken 
            vermicelli noodles or couscous, and then sweetening and 
            serving them with powdered sugar, ground fried almonds, 
            raisins, and cinnamon. Because it is somewhat sweet but 
            still has savory notes with the vermicelli, Seffa is often 
            eaten just after the main meal, according to E Persian food. 
            The dish is a showstopper, as it is often served in a mound, 
            piled high with trails of sugar and cinnamon alternated down 
            the mound. To incorporate additional savory notes, Seffa is 
            sometimes served with meat such as lamb, beef, or saffron 
            chicken, which ups the fanciness a bit and makes it suitable 
            for weddings and other special occasions. This version is 
            referred to as Seffa Medfouna, which means Seffa buried and 
            refers to the meat that's hidden within the mound.

            ginger, onions, and spices then topped with syrup-cooked prunes, and finally 
            decorated with fried almonds.Lamb or beef tagines with prunes are the best food 
            you can try in local restaurants in Morocco.This recipe is also quite easy to try 
            at home, and you don't need a Tagine pot. A conventional pot with a heavy bottom can do just fine.

            number of calories and a large amount of fats- makes the body invest a lot of 
            energy in its digestion process. In Moroccan society, people tend to have fatty, 
            high-calorie dishes, as they constitute for them full meals to compensate for the 
            energy they lose after the long and tiring workdays or cold winter days. Trotters
