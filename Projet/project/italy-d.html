            Zuccotto is a traditional Italian dessert that is similar to a dome-shaped 
            ice cream cake. It is made from a mixture of sponge cake, gelato or ice 
            cream, and liqueurs or fruit, which are combined and chilled until firm. 
            The dessert is then sliced and served as a cold, refreshing treat. Zuccotto 
            is a popular dessert in Italy and is often served as a special treat or at 
            celebrations, such as weddings and holidays. It is widely available in 
            Italian-style confectionery shops and ice cream parlors around the world.
